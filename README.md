> :warning: This repository has been archived since we unified the source code for both .NET and .NET-Core clients a while back. The last release done here was 5.0.0 and this repo won't receive any further maintenance as the source code for the client current versions is not kept here anymore.  
If you're looking for historical data, we've had performed some releases for this client from the now also archived [.net-core-client repository](https://github.com/splitio/.net-core-client).  
For current and future releases, reporting issues or submitting any PRs, please see our unified and final [dotnet-client repository](https://github.com/splitio/dotnet-client).

### Commitment to Quality:

Split’s SDKs are in active development and are constantly tested for quality. Unit tests are developed for each SDK based on the unique needs of that language, and integration tests, load and performance tests, and behavior consistency tests are running 24/7 via automated bots. In addition, monitoring instrumentation ensures that these SDKs behave under the expected parameters of memory, CPU, and I/O.
